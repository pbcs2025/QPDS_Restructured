# MBA Faculty Bulk Upload - Sample Document

## Excel/CSV Format

When uploading MBA faculty via Excel or CSV, ensure your file has the following columns (header row required):

### Required Columns:
- **name** (required) - Full name of the faculty member
- **email** (required) - Email address (will be used as username)
- **deptName** (required) - Must match exactly with existing MBA department names in the system

### Optional Columns:
- **phone** - 10-digit contact number
- **clgName** - College name
- **usertype** - Either "internal" or "external" (defaults to "internal" if not provided)

## Sample Data

Here's a sample of how your Excel/CSV should look:

| name | email | phone | clgName | deptName | usertype |
|------|-------|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| Dr. John Smith | john.smith@example.com | 9876543210 | Global Academy of Technology | Finance | internal |
| Prof. Jane Doe | jane.doe@example.com | 9876543211 | Global Academy of Technology | Marketing | internal |
| Mr. Robert Johnson | robert.j@external.edu | 9876543212 | External College | Human Resources | external |
| Dr. Sarah Williams | sarah.w@example.com | 9876543213 | Global Academy of Technology | Operations | internal |

## Important Notes:

1. **Department Names**: The `deptName` must match **exactly** with the department names in your MBA departments list. Common examples:
   - Finance
   - Marketing
   - Human Resources
   - Operations
   - Information Systems
   - Strategy
   - Entrepreneurship
   - (Add your actual MBA department names here)

2. **Email Uniqueness**: Each email must be unique. If a faculty with the same email already exists, that row will be skipped.

3. **Password Generation**: The system will automatically generate a 6-character alphanumeric password for each faculty member. This will be sent to their email address.

4. **User Type**:
   - **internal**: Faculty from Global Academy of Technology (clgName will be auto-set)
   - **external**: Faculty from other colleges (must provide clgName)

## Sample Document for Database Insertion

If you prefer to insert directly into the database, here's a sample structure:

### User Collection Sample:
```json
{
  "name": "Dr. John Smith",
  "username": "john.smith@example.com",
  "clgName": "Global Academy of Technology",
  "deptName": "Finance",
  "email": "john.smith@example.com",
  "phoneNo": "9876543210",
  "password": "AutoGenerated",
  "usertype": "internal",
  "role": "MBAFaculty"
}
```

### MBAFaculty Collection Sample:
```json
{
  "facultyId": "ObjectId reference to User",
  "name": "Dr. John Smith",
  "email": "john.smith@example.com",
  "passwordHash": "AutoGenerated",
  "department": "Finance",
  "clgName": "Global Academy of Technology",
  "contactNumber": "9876543210",
  "type": "internal",
  "role": "mba-faculty",
  "isActive": true
}
```

## Notes for Database Insertion:

1. **User Collection**:
   - `username` should be the same as `email`
   - `role` must be set to `"MBAFaculty"`
   - `password` will be auto-generated (6-character alphanumeric)

2. **MBAFaculty Collection**:
   - `facultyId` must reference the `_id` from the User collection
   - `passwordHash` should match the password from User collection
   - `department` must match an existing MBA department name
   - `isActive` defaults to `true`

3. **Relationships**:
   - Each MBAFaculty document must have a corresponding User document
   - The `facultyId` in MBAFaculty references `_id` in User

## Verification

After insertion, verify:
1. User document exists with `role: "MBAFaculty"`
2. MBAFaculty document exists with matching `facultyId`
3. Email is unique across both collections
4. Department name matches an active MBA department
