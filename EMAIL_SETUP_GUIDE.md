# Email Configuration Setup Guide

## ðŸš¨ Issue Fixed: "Missing credentials for PLAIN"

The email functionality has been updated to gracefully handle missing credentials. Here's how to set it up:

## âœ… Current Behavior (Without Email Setup)
- âœ… Registration and login work perfectly
- âœ… Verification codes are displayed in server console
- âœ… No email errors or crashes
- âœ… System provides clear setup instructions

## ðŸ“§ To Enable Email Functionality

### Step 1: Create `.env` file
Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory with the following content:

```env
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://prathibhabcs:globalacademyoftechnology@clusterqpds.6ybfzvb.mongodb.net/GAT_QPDS

# Email Configuration (Gmail SMTP)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Step 2: Gmail App Password Setup
1. **Go to Google Account Settings**: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** (if not already enabled)
3. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (custom name)"
   - Name it "QPDS Faculty System"
   - Copy the 16-character password

### Step 3: Update .env file
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-actual-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

## ðŸ”§ Alternative Email Providers

### Using Outlook/Hotmail
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Using Yahoo Mail
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Email Functionality

After setting up the `.env` file:

1. **Restart the backend server**
2. **Test faculty registration** from AdminManageFaculty
3. **Test faculty login** - verification code should be sent via email

- Faculty registration through AdminManageFaculty
- Faculty login with email as username

1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && npm start`
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend_end && npm start`
